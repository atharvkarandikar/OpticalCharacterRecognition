The code you provided is a Python Flask application that performs OCR on prescription images. The application uses the following libraries:

# os: This library provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
pytesseract: This library is used to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on images.

#PIL: This library is used to work with images in Python.

#flask: This library is used to create web applications in Python.
The application works as follows:

The user uploads a prescription image to the application.
The application uses the pytesseract library to perform OCR on the image.
The text of the prescription is extracted from the image and returned to the user.
The application is also able to display the text of the prescription on a web page.

Here are some additional things you can study about the code:

The ocr_prescription() function is used to perform OCR on the prescription image. This function takes the path to the image as input and returns the text of the prescription as plaintext.
The index.html template is used to display the text of the prescription on a web page. This template takes the text of the prescription as input and renders it in a web page.
The app.run() function is used to run the Flask application. This function takes the debug=True argument, which means that the application will be run in debug mode.
